Q. Explain the concept of recursion and how it can simplify certain problems
Ans. Recursion: A programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. It simplifies problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems that are similar to the original problem.
Simplification: Recursion can simplify the code and make it more elegant for problems that have a natural recursive structure, such as calculating factorials, navigating hierarchical data structures, or implementing algorithms like binary search. It can reduce complex iterative solutions into more readable and concise code.

Analysis

Q. Discuss the time complexity of your recursive algorithm
Ans. Time Complexity: The time complexity of a recursive algorithm depends on the number of recursive calls and the work done at each level. For instance, a simple recursive algorithm with a linear number of recursive calls has a time complexity of O(n), while algorithms with multiple recursive calls per step, like those solving the Fibonacci sequence naively, can have exponential time complexity, O(2^n).

Q. Explain how to optimize the recursive solution to avoid excessive computation
Ans. Memoization: Store the results of expensive function calls and reuse them when the same inputs occur again. This technique reduces the number of recursive calls and improves efficiency.
Dynamic Programming: Convert the recursive approach into an iterative one by solving sub-problems and storing their solutions, thereby avoiding redundant calculations.
Tail Recursion: Optimize recursive algorithms where the recursive call is the last operation performed. Tail recursion can be optimized by compilers or interpreters to improve performance and avoid stack overflow errors.
